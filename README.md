# state-quiz

My idea for state quiz is as follows:

1. Test your knowledge of the 50 United States
   - easy (30 or so states filled in / multiple choice)
   - medium
   - hard 
   - extreme (no states filled in)
2. Given an individual state, guess the name
3. Given an individual state, guess the capital
4. GIS (given an individual state), guess the year it was founded
5. GIS, guess the senator(s)
